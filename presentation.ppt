Digital Footprint and Privacy:

A digital footprint refers to the trail of data created by a person's online activities, while privacy in the digital age involves controlling how personal information is collected, used, and shared online. Your digital footprint can impact your privacy by revealing personal information to others, potentially leading to security risks, identity theft, and unwanted marketing. It's crucial to be mindful of what information you share online and to take steps to manage and protect your digital footprint. 
Your digital footprint may include:
Websites visited
Search history
Posts on social media
Records of online purchases
Comments on news articles
Messages sent
You create your digital footprint whenever you:
Post online
Search online
Share content
Allow a website to install cookies on your device
Share your IP address, login details, and other personal information
Information that others post about you may also contribute to your digital footprint. And traces of your footprint may appear when someone searches your name online.
Types of digital footprints:-
There are two types of digital footprints: active and passive digital footprints. The digital footprint type depends on whether you willingly shared data online vs. information you unknowingly left behind.
Active digital footprints
Active digital footprints are the information you choose to share online, including posts you make on social media channels and personal information you share.
Examples of active digital footprints include:
Posting on social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and X (formerly Twitter)
Filling out online forms or signing up to receive emails or texts
Agreeing to install cookies on your devices
You have more control over this digital footprint because you decide what to post, which forms to fill out, and whether to accept cookies on certain websites. By controlling the information you put out there, you’re allowing platforms to use it only according to your terms.
Passive digital footprints
Passive digital footprints are those you leave behind without intending to or, in some cases, without even knowing it.
Examples of passive digital footprints include:
Websites that install cookies in your device without disclosing them
Apps and websites that use geolocation to pinpoint your location
Social media channels and advertisers that use your likes, shares, and comments to profile you and to serve up advertisements based on your interests
Websites that collect information about how many times you’ve visited recently
Websites can collect this data when a device at your IP address connects with their website, even if you don’t notice. Because of this hidden process, keeping track of your passive digital footprint is tricky.
Why is your digital footprint important?
Your digital footprint is important because it:
Lasts a long time: Once something is online, it's hard to erase, especially on social media.
Shapes your online image: What you post online can affect how people see you.
Impacts opportunities: Schools and employers might look at your online persona before hiring or accepting you.
You must be aware of your digital footprint to protect yourself from various online threats. For example, people may twist your words and use your photos to cause you or your loved ones harm. Bad actors may also share your private messages in a public forum. On top of all that, hackers may steal your information and use it to run phishing scams on others.
Digital footprint examples
Digital footprints are larger than you might think and can include all kinds of data—from social media posts and comments to banking data. Here are some examples of digital footprints.
Shopping data: Purchase history, account creations, and newsletter signups from e-commerce websites
Financial data: Banking app activity, credit card usage, stock purchases, and financial newsletter subscriptions
Fitness and health data: Gym membership emails, fitness blog subscriptions, and workout app usage
News and reading data: Online news subscriptions, news app usage, newsletter signups, and shared articles
Social media data: Posting on social media platforms, following user accounts, uploading photos and videos, and creating dating profiles
How to protect your digital footprint
Sometimes it may be difficult to know if you’re creating your digital footprint actively or passively, but there are steps you can take to minimize it. Here’s how to take more control over your active and passive digital footprint and reduce the trail of data you leave behind online.
1. Enter your name into several search engines
The first step to protecting your digital footprint is tracking the trail you leave online. To do this, use search engines to discover what's publicly listed about you. For instance, search:
Name and city
Name and employer
Name and high school or college
2. Review your social media privacy settings
Privacy settings on social media allow you to control who sees your posts on your social media streams. Spend some time getting to know these settings so you have more control over the visibility of your interactions.

3. Create strong passwords
Strong passwords act as gatekeepers to protect your data and your overall digital footprint.
Here's how to create them:
Avoid simple passwords: Don't use dictionary words, birthdays, or personal information like pet names that can be easily guessed. Hackers can crack these with a little info about you or through brute force attacks.
Mix it up: Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The longer and more complex, the better.
Consider a password manager: If remembering unique passwords is tough, a password manager can help. These tools create strong passwords and store them securely.
4. Keep all your software up to date
Computer viruses and other malware may try to mine your digital footprint, which is constantly getting updated. To help protect yourself, ensure that your antivirus software and other software programs are up to date. Software updates patch existing vulnerabilities and introduce new features like improved firewalls to help combat the latest threats.

5. Review your mobile apps—if you don’t need it, delete it
From time to time, review the apps on your phone or tablet. What are their privacy or information-sharing settings? If you don’t use an app anymore, delete it.
6. Build a positive reputation
Create a positive digital footprint by posting information that adds to the image of you that you want your employer, banks, teachers, and others to see.
Post thoughtfully: Share content that reflects well for employers, schools, etc.
Clean up your social media: Untag yourself from questionable photos and keep critical comments to yourself.
Build a positive online presence: Showcase your skills or hobbies through a blog or website.
Remember that employers, colleges, and others can look up your digital footprint to understand your online reputation. Keeping a clean online presence may help you in the future.
7. Use a VPN
Another way to help safeguard your digital footprint is to use a virtual private network, or VPN.
VPNs can:
Protect your privacy online
Encrypt the data you send and receive online
Mask your IP address
Give you online anonymity
VPNs help by masking your IP address so your online actions are virtually untraceable. Norton VPN can help secure your private information and prevent websites from collecting your data.
Can anyone see my digital footprint?
Yes, much of your digital footprint is public, which is why it’s so important to watch what you say and do online. Be mindful whenever you post on social media or communicate with your followers.
Who can see your digital footprint?
Your digital footprint is available to the following groups of people:
Employers
Schools
Colleges
Law enforcement officials
Data brokers
Advertisers
Phone companies
Internet providers
Peers
Coworkers
Cybercriminals
Hackers
How do I remove my digital footprint?
While removing your digital footprint is nearly impossible, there are steps you can take to minimize the data trail you leave behind, such as deleting tracking cookies and deleting or deactivating your unused social media accounts. For accounts you still use, adjust the privacy settings to control who can access your information.
How serious is a digital footprint?
Your digital footprint is very important, both online and offline. Potential employers, schools, and even cybercriminals can view your online activity. It’s important to be mindful of what you post online, keep track of your digital activity, and use privacy settings.
How do you track your digital footprint?
You can track your digital footprint by entering your name, city, employer, school, and other associations into a search engine. You can also set up search alerts to be notified when someone posts something related to you. Use a VPN and other cybersecurity tools like anti-tracking software to keep your browsing history more private.
